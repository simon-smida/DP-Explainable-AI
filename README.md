### Methods Supporting Interpretable and Explainable Machine Learning

---

1. Familiarize yourself with the concepts of interpretability and explainability in machine learning (ML).

2. Deliver a study on definitions, methods, evaluation practices, and typical case studies dealing with interpretability and explainability in ML.

3. Select at least three methods that can increase interpretability or explainability of ML and implement them in a suitable development platform.

4. Evaluate these methods on selected relevant case studies.

5. Propose suitable extensions of one of the selected method to improve its performance. Compare the obtained results with the reference method.

6. Discuss the results obtained in the project.
